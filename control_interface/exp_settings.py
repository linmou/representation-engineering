            You are Detective Marcus Lee.

            At Riverside Bank, known for its impeccable security, an astonishing event occurred. On Monday morning, employees discovered that over $2 million was missing from the vault. The vault door was found closed and locked, and the alarm system hadn't been triggered.

            Detective Marcus Lee was called in to investigate. The bank's security relies on a combination of biometric scans, passcodes, and time-locked systems. Access is limited to a few high-level employees.

            Key Information:
            Bank Employees with Vault Access:

            Karen (Bank Manager): Has ultimate control over vault access.
            Michael (Head of Security): Oversees all security protocols.
            Linda (Senior Teller): Trusted with vault access during business hours.
            Other Relevant Individuals:

            Tom (IT Specialist): Responsible for the bank's computer systems.
            Evelyn (Cleaning Staff): Works after hours; doesn't have vault access.
            Clues:
            Security Logs:

            Vault access was granted at 11:45 PM on Sunday.
            Access was granted using Karen's biometric credentials.
            Karen insists she was at home and didn't access the vault.
            Camera Footage:

            Cameras malfunctioned between 11:30 PM and 12:00 AM.
            Prior to the malfunction, Tom was seen entering the server room.
            Witness Statements:

            Michael reports that Linda had asked unusual questions about security protocols last week.
            Evelyn mentions seeing Tom and Karen having a heated discussion on Friday evening.
            Physical Evidence:

            A USB drive was found plugged into a computer in the server room.
            Footprints matching Evelyn's shoes were found near the vault, though she claims she never goes there.
            Additional Information:

            Karen is under financial strain due to personal debts.
            Tom recently booked a non-refundable trip to a luxury resort.
            Linda has an impeccable record but recently complained about job dissatisfaction.
            Evelyn supports a sick family member requiring expensive treatment.

            Decide who you think is responsible for the crime. And explain your reasoning.

I’ve contributed to projects in market research and data modeling, but I’m most proud of the collaborative work we’ve done to support small businesses during the pandemic. In fact, our team was recognized for our efforts with the Innovation in Data Award.

I’m also someone who values a simple life. In my spare time, you’ll likely find me reading a book or volunteering at the local animal shelter, where I’ve been a regular for the past five years. First-Impression:''' ,

In fact, one of the apps I worked on last year won the User Experience Award for its simplicity and design.

I studied Computer Science at University of California, Berkeley, and have been working in the tech industry for the past five years. When I’m not coding, I love to play the guitar at local venues, where I get to share my love of music with others.

I’m also passionate about volunteering and frequently participate in charity hackathons that raise money for important causes. I love meeting new people, trying new things, and always looking for ways to make the world a better place. First-Impression:''',
